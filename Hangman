""" We all know the game hangman. It fills up our time when we don't know what to play with our friends. In my version of hangman, a player has as many
chances as the length of the word. If they guess a letter incorrectly, they lose a chance, even if they've already guessed the incorrect letter 
previously. At each iteration, the player is informed of how many chances they have left.
The player can keep guessing until they either win the game, or lose all their chances, at which point a message appears with the word that was meant 
to be guessed. """
