"""
When writing out a list of items in English, one normally separates the items with
commas. In addition, the word “and” is normally included before the last item, unless
the list only contains one item. Consider the following four lists:
                                        apples
                                        apples and oranges
                                        apples, oranges and bananas
                                        apples, oranges, bananas and lemons
Write a function that takes a list of strings as its only parameter. Your function
should return a string that contains all of the items in the list formatted in the manner
described previously as its only result. Include a main program that reads several items from the user,formats them by calling 
your function, and then displays the result returned by the function."""
